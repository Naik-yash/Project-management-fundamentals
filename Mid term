Question 1
2.9 / 3 pts
Javier, an employee at Stevens, is leading a new project aimed at better serving new graduate students at Stevens.  (It will likely include a new orientation program and new on-line systems solutions.)  As project manager he will be working with colleagues from human resources, IT, and admissions.  He expects to have 20 team members on his EXTENDED team and has been advised to form a small core team.

a) Define who should be on the core team; be specific.

b) Describe the key role of a core team.

c) Identify, by role, three stakeholders on this project

Your Answer:
A) The Core Team is the group of individuals who have day-to-day responsibility for planning and managing the project activities. This is typically a cross-functional group. The Core Team would consist of the core team leader and the Core team member from each function that has a significant role in project execution. It should contain one lead member of each of the contributing departments. In the given case, the departments would include Graduate admissions, IT, and human resource. Apart for these, it should also contain at least one student and faculty representative.

 

B) As mentioned above in the definition of a core team, the key roles would be managing the tasks, monitoring, planning, and also budgeting.

 

C) The three stakeholders on this project would be the student, the faculty, and the graduate admissions department.

 
Question 2

Juliet is leading a $1M IT project.  She is concerned that the requirements are unclear AND ALSO that the technology may become obsolete before the project is ended.  Her team absolutely agrees with the first concern, but assesses only a 30% chance of the second concern.  Either would impact the project's success significantly. 

a. Create a risk analysis matrix, using qualitative scoring

b. Name 4 "generic" TYPES of risk responses

c. Which TYPE of response would you recommend for the top-priority risk and give your recommended risk response.

d.  In order to get the attention of senior leadership, what additional step in risk analysis could she take to get the attention of senior leadership? and offer an example

Your Answer:
A) Risk Analysis Matrix using qualitative scoring:

Risk	Probability 	Impact	Overall
Technology Issues	Low	High	10
Not well defined / Unclear requirements 	High	High	90
 

B) The 4 "generic" types of risk responses are mentioned below:

1.Avoid 

2.Enhance

3.Exploit

4.Reduce

 

C) I think the response I would suggest for a top-priority risk is AVOID. Because I think it is better to change strategies and plan accordingly so as to avoid the risk.

 

D)  In order to get the attention of senior leadership, she should ask for clearer and well defined requirements in the initial stage itself i.e. the initialization phase.

 
Question 3

Calculate the net present value of the following short-term project, aimed at cost savings.

Cost=100,000.  Cost savings = 30,000 in both year 1 AND 2, and $60,000 in year 3.  (Assume a 10% interest rate) 

a) NPV= ??         (show the equation also)

b) What would you recommend? (go/no-go, and why)

c) In which life-cycle phase would this be used?

Your Answer:
Initial Cost = $100,000

Cost Saving in the First Year = $30,000 ---> FV1

Cost Saving in the Second year = $30,000 --->FV2

Cost Saving in the Third year = $60,000 --->FV3

Formula-

NPV = Summation of all years in context of (FV/(1+interest rate) the number of year) - initial cost

= [30000/(1+0.1) 1] + [30000/(1+0.1) 2] + [60000/(1+0.1) 3] - 100,000

      First year                Second year           Third year             I.C.

=$ -2854.99

 

B) I would recommend a 'No-go' as it is a loss(indicated by the negative sign).

 

C)This would be used in the Planning phase.

Maria is a new project manager working in an organization that uses a traditional life cycle. Her technical lead on the project, David, is not a big fan of planning. He says, “Things always change, so this is all a waste of my time. Why should I even have to bother doing this?   And if you want a plan so badly, you develop it alone. “   List two distinct points she should include in her response.

 

 

 

Your Answer:
She should include the 2 points mentioned below in her response-

1. She should mention the importance of Planning in a project life cycle, and how it can avoid risks. Also that the plan could be generalized in order to accommodate any changing scope or requirements by implementing agile procedures.

 

2.Planning also helps in responding to risks, timeline estimation, and the Work breakdown structure.

Question 6

Jorge is a new project manager of a medium-large matrixed project who has been trying to “prove himself” by showing he can handle the project ALONE. He was assigned the project and immediately began to write a project plan on his own. He suffers, though, from having resources pulled off his project and cannot get sign-off. In speaking to a mentor, he was advised to “get more organizational alignment”… To do that, what are two specific tips would you offer him for consideration…

Your Answer:
The two specific tips I would offer him for consideration are as follows:

1. Creating a Core Team-

The Core Team is the group of individuals who have day-to-day responsibility for planning and managing the project activities. It is a cross-functional group. And has members from various departments of the company. It is important because it is always good to have people from all the various departments so as to avoid and also mitigate the risks the project might face. Also if an error or delay occurs in a particular element, it can be compensated by the other elements of the project life cycle.

 

2. Maintaining good communication with the stakeholders-

Aligning with the main stakeholders of the parent organization is always better. So that even in case of tight situations, he has their support.

 
Question 7
1.5 / 1.5 pts
You need to make a quick "build or buy" decision.  You can buy a solution for $1M (however there is a 10% chance of an additional $100K in costs).  You can build a solution for $800K (however there is a 50% chance of additional customization costs of $400K).

 

What is the cost to build, to buy, and your recommendation based solely upon this financial analysis?

Your Answer:
Given data:

Buy-

Cost= $1M

There is a 10% chance of additional 100k cost

EMV = $1M + 0.1 *100k

=$1M + $10,000

=$1.01M

Build-

Cost= $800k

There is a 50% chance of additional 400k cost

EMV= $800k + 0.5 * 400k

=$800k + $200k

=$1M

 

Therefore, as Build < Buy, Build is the most cost effective way.
